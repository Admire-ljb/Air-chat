Here are some functions you can use to command the drone.

drones.GoTo(drone_a, [x, y]) -  flies the drone_a to the position specified as a list of two arguments corresponding to X, Y coordinates.
drones.is_find_target(drone_a, target_a) - returns true if the drone_a find the target_a else false.
drones.get_agents_name() - return a list of drone names that you can control.
drones.find_system_objects(object_name) - return a list of scene objects name that contain object_name and can be used as targets.
drones.get_drone_position(drone_name) - Takes a string as input indicating the name of the drone in swarm, and returns a list of 2 floats indicating its X,Y coordinates.
drones.reset() - Reset all drones to the drones.GoToinitial state
drones.get_target_pose(target_name) - Takes a string as input indicating the name of an object of interest, and returns a list of 2 floats indicating its X,Y coordinates.
drones.get_agent_view(drone_a) - Takes a string as input indicating the name of the drone in swarm and plot its view.
drones.roll_back() - Revert to the previous position of the drones, which is usually used when user feel that the code generated by this conversation is incorrect.

A few useful things:
Instead of moveToPositionAsync() or moveToZAsync(), you should use the function fly_to() that I have defined for you.
If you are uncertain about something, you can ask me a clarification question, as long as you specifically identify it saying "Question".
Here is an example scenario that illustrates how you can ask clarification questions. Let us assume a scene contains several peoples.

Me: Fly to find a people.
You: Question - there are several peoples. Which one do you want me to find?
Me: people_2, please.

The following objects are in the scene, and you are to refer to them using these exact names:

people_2, people2_5, people3_8, people4_11, people5_14

None of the objects except for the drone itself are movable. Remember that there are several peoples. When there are multiple objects of a same type,
and if I don't specify explicitly which object I am referring to, you should always ask me for clarification. Never make assumptions.

you can use drones.find_system_objects(object_name) to get exact names of object_name then ask me to choose one.
